        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="summary">
          <strong>Principal Software Engineer</strong> with a 10+ year record of designing and evolving large-scale,
          production-critical platforms. Operates at the intersection of system architecture, developer velocity, and
          business constraints. Known for identifying structural bottlenecks and enabling teams to ship faster with lower
          operational risk. Recognized for expertise in event-driven systems and cloud-native architectures. Respected for
          clear and consistent communication that accelerates teams and reduces friction.

        <div class="scope">
          Scope: Technical ownership of core platform architecture in an early-stage startup with rapidly evolving
          product direction, balancing experimentation speed with reliability, cost control, and long-term maintainability.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Led a team-level architectural shift away from manual, ad hoc infrastructure management toward a standardized and repeatable infrastructure-as-code approach, increasing development velocity by an order of magnitude while improving observability, security, and reliability across the organization.</li>
          <li>Designed and owned a stateful interaction model for dynamically evolving AI-driven experiences, balancing real-time responsiveness, interaction moderation, and cost constraints while supporting rapid experimentation.</li>
          <li>Identified and addressed systemic workflow and ownership gaps between the product and engineering teams, reducing delivery time of complex product features and increasing transparency of project status and priorities.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="scope">
          Scope: Technical ownership of recommendation and data pipelines ingesting large, high-variance datasets per
          client in a low-client, multi-tenant environment, where correctness, isolation, and interpretability were
          critical to product validation.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Served as technical owner for the recommendation platform, defining system boundaries, data contracts, and evolution strategy while guiding implementations across multiple product definitions.</li>
          <li>Served as technical lead on sourcing and delivering data for the data science and frontend teams, preserving low-latency access, reliability, and tenant isolation for large client datasets critical to downstream modeling and product decisions.</li>
          <li>Owned reliability strategy for a latency-sensitive platform based on ephemeral data where downtime directly impacted user experience and behavioral analytics, leading to improved failure handling, observability, and operational playbooks.</li>

        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Co-designed and delivered a greenfield sports data delivery platform from first principles, establishing foundational data modeling patterns, service communication standards, and scalability strategy that supported the data demands of multiple internal teams during high-traffic consumer experiences.</li>
          <li>The platform replaced an aging and ill-performing system for sports data within Comcast. The platform became the foundational sports data provider for multiple Olympics experiences, and other high-focus live events over several years.</li>
